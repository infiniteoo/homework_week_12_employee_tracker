<br/>

![example gif](/example/example.gif)

### Overview

The focus of this assignment was to build and maintain a MYSQL database with queries made through
Node.js and Inquirer in Javascript.  After creating the schema for the database and seeding it with dummy data, the user is able to add, update and delete rows from the database, as well as make various view queries to see the data contained within.

These were the homework's posted minimum requrements:

* Add departments, roles, employees
* View departments, roles, employees
* Update employee roles

with Bonus points attainable my beeting these criteria:

* Update employee managers
* View employees by manager
* delete departments, roles, and employees
* View the total utilized budget of a department


### Review of Tasks

Overall, this project was so valuable to me and my learning process.  Being able to interact with an
SQL database is a very important and fundamental need for any full stack developer, and I can confidently say I left this project with so much more understanding than when I went into it.  

Special props need to be given to fellow bootcamp student "cmelby" for their ViewAllEmployees query. Without their help I would have been lost.

#### Here are the steps taken to achieve this complete this week's homework project:

* Built initial file system structure and deployed basic blueprint to Github to complete repository construction.
* Sketched out pseudo code logic and transcribed them into the code as comments.
* Created database schema structure including the three tables needed.
* Created database seed schema to quickly and easily populate my database with new dummy data after i corrupt it one way or another.
* Initiated connection with localhost MYSQL database.
* Built "main menu" prompt and various functions connected to each selection in the menu.
* Really delved deep into MYSQL queries and how relational databases are structured and communicate within themselves via various INNER JOIN queries. 
* Purchased "SQL QuickStart Guide" by Walter Shields for further research.


*After multiple trial and error debugging sessions, all applied logic appears sound and no bugs can be generated from purposeful negligent entries.  From this point, it was time to clean up:*

* Refactor reduntant and worthless code.
* Removed multiple, annoying console.log commands used for debugging.
* Double-checked to ensured code was properly formatted and commented before submission.
* Produced animated gif of program working in action.
* Used code validation service.
* Wrote README.MD file.
* Added animated gif to README.
 

### Installation

Installation should be fairly straightforward, but here's a quick guide to get up and running, assuming you have **Visual Studio Code** and **Git** (with the accompanying interface **Git Bash**) installed.

* from your shell input the command: `git clone https://github.com/infiniteoo/homework_week_12_employee_tracker`
* once downloaded, from the working directory in the shell, input the command: `npm install` to access the various dependencies.
* after installation is complete, input the command `node start` to run the program.
